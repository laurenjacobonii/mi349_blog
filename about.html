            <p>My name is Lauren Jacoboni. I in my fourth year at Michigan State University, currently studying Information Science. I have also had an intrest inn technology and the sceince behind how all of it works. 
                I am from Plymouth, Michigan. I have lived there my whole life with my father and my two brothers. About five years ago my oldest brother god married and he now has four young boys. My otehr brother is 23 and has started his carrer in building a construction company.
                My dad is a "snowbird" meaning he spends his winters down in Naples, Florida. This has been super cool the past few years allowing me to go down a visit him when school gives me the chance.
