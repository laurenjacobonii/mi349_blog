                For my first blog post I choose to write about golf. Golf has been in my life since I was very young because my dad has always loved it so much. Growing up I really was not interested and honestly, I couldnâ€™t have cared less about it. About five years ago, my dad got me out on the course a few times and shortly after that I fell in love with it. From taking lessons, to playing in tournaments, golf quickly became my biggest hobby. About two or so years ago I started to try and get my friends involved in it, as a good way to get outside and spend time together. Similar to me, at first they were not interested but after a few rounds, they were addicted. In the summer of 2023 my best friend Jenna and I played 18 holes everyday of the summer, only missing a total of 7 days off the course. That is when we realized our addiction to the sport may be unhealthy so we tried other hobbies but always ended up at some golf course somehow. It is not an easy sport, and if you are anything like me, you definitely have more bad days than good out on the course but it is fun and encourages movement and good memories so I love it.

                In my second blog post I wanted to give everyone a run down on this past summer for me. If you have read my previous post, you can assume that I spent a decent amount of my time this summer golfing, but my best friend Jenna and I also searched for more hobbies. We checked out the Detroit Tigers game which neither of us have attended in awhile. We also explored around Traverse City and checked out some cool wineries up there! With all of these expenses, Jenna and I both realized we needed summer jobs so we split off and I started serving at a restaurant in downtown Brighton and she served at a restaurant in Plymouth. Don't worry, we were able to plan around our schedules and play 38 rounds of golf this summer,  a total of  684 holes. This may sound like a lot but we had definitely cut back compared to the summer of 2023. As summer came to an end, before all of my highschool friends and I split up for one final year of college all across the U.S. we enjoyed our yearly Houghton Lake week long trip. This has been a tradition now for three years and it is always something we all look forward to.
